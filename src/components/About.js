                <p>The free online CV generator is absolutely 100% free and was developed in order for me to learn React development.</p>
                <p>The application is deliberately hosted on a free hosting platform with a free domain name so that no money needs to be generated in order
                    to keep it running.</p>
                <p>No data is stored on a server and no cookies are used to store personal data.</p>
                <p>All of your data is stored in memory within the browser until you click the download button at which point the data is saved in a file on your computer.</p>
                <p>It is important that you do not hit the refresh button before saving your CV otherwise everything you have entered will be lost.</p>
